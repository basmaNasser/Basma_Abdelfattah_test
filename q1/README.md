## Ormuco test

### Description

Your goal for this question is to write a program that accepts two lines (x1,x2) and (x3,x4) on the x-axis and returns whether 
they overlap. As an example, (1,5) and (2,6) overlaps but not (1,5) and (6,8).

### The Answer

source directory: `./q1`
test cases file: test_case_overlapping.py

### Example:
overlapping((1,5),(2,6))

output: overlapping

It will return:
text message "overlapping" if the two lines overlaps
text message "no overlapping" if the two lines not overlaps
